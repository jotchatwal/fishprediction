# Fish Weight Prediction

This project aims to predict the weight of a fish given its length, height, and width using a regression model. The model was built using the `sklearn` library in Python and served through a Flask web application.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/`
  - `Fish.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
- `model/`
  - `ml_app.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the model training and evaluation code.
  - `regressor.pkl`: Serialized regression model.
- `templates/`
  - `index.html`: HTML template for the web application.
- `app.py`: Flask application code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <URL_to_your_GitHub_repo>
   cd <repo_name>
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Ensure that you have the required models (`regressor.pkl`) in the `model/` directory.**

2. **Start the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open your web browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Usage

### Predict Weight

- **Input Fields:**
  - Length1, Length2, Length3: Length measurements of the fish.
  - Height: Height of the fish.
  - Width: Width of the fish.

- **Output:**
  - Predicted weight of the fish.

### Web Interface

The web interface consists of a form where you can input the length, height, and width of the fish to get the predicted weight.
